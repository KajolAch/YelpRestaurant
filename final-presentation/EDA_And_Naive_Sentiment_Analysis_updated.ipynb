    "\n",
    "The reputation of any business entity is driven by its customer ratings and reviews. The hospitality industry is no exception to this rule, and the reputation of restaurants as well depends on the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Positive reviews can lead to increase in business revenue, whereas negative ones can drive away potential customers and affect the business prestige, profitability and trustworthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers search for restaurants in search engines and/or local-search services like Yelp.com. Nowadays everyone checks online rating and reviews before visiting the restaurant. Ratings displayed online gives an overall review of the restaurant, but fails to provide details regarding important features/aspect like the quality of food, quality of service, ambience, cleanliness, price, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, customers have to read through the reviews, to analyze the restaurant and select the one that best suits their personal preferences. If a customer wants to know the restaurant rating based on some specific aspects they have to read many reviews and check if any review mentions something about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the process of finding restaurants more personalized and convenient, we have come up with a project idea to create a model that provides ratings for different aspects of the restaurants based on the customer reviews on Yelp."

    "2.  Cleanliness\n",
    "3.  Food\n",
